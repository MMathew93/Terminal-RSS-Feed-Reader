# Personal Projects to Practice Ruby With
Just wanted to start doing some personal projects to practice Ruby more in-depth.
I've been following along with the Odin Project doing some of their projects but at times
things are a bit slow on my end. Figured doing mini updates to my github with projects would be a lot better than long hiatuses while I look for work and continue learning.

# About the Project
Basically this project is just a simple RSS feed reader you run in your terminal.
I've set it up to take in multiple RSS feeds and will just display the title, description,
and link to the original content
